# 📊 Data Collection Showcase

This document outlines the comprehensive dataset generated by the Triage Evaluation Study application. The system records high-fidelity metrics across two primary streams: **Granular Operational Data** and **Cognitive Workload Data**.

## 1. Operational Event Logs (`logs.csv`)
**Purpose**: Captures every micro-interaction, decision, and time-interval to reconstruct the exact workflow of the participant.

| Category | Field Name | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Session Context** | `session_id` | Unique UUID for the participant session. |
| | `timestamp_utc` | Exact time of the event (ISO 8601). |
| | `participant_role` | Self-reported role (e.g., Paramedic, Doctor, Police). |
| | `tool_id` | Triage Tool used (e.g., ATS, SMART, 10S). |
| | `app_version` | Version of the app used for traceability. |
| **Scenario Context** | `scenario_type` | The experimental block (e.g., Entrapment, Violence). |
| | `patient_id` | Unique ID of the patient being treated. |
| **Action & Timing** | `event_type` | Type of interaction: `reveal` (button click), `decision` (triage), `card_start`. |
| | `action_key` | Specific item checked (e.g., `airway_man`, `pulse_rate`, `bp`). |
| | `t_real_ms` | Real-world milliseconds elapsed since patient card opened. |
| | `t_sim_ms` | Accumulated "Simulation Time" (accounting for time costs of actions). |
| **Triage Performance** | `decision_raw` | The specific label clicked (e.g., "Immediate", "P1"). |
| | `decision_normalized` | Standardized color code (Red, Yellow, Green, Black). |
| | `gold_standard` | Expert-validated correct outcome for this specific tool. |
| | `correct` | Binary accuracy flag (`1` = Correct, `0` = Incorrect). |
| | `deviation` | Integer error magnitude (Negative = Undertriage, Positive = Overtriage, 0 = Perfect). |

## 2. Cognitive Workload Logs (`nasa_tlx_logs.csv`)
**Purpose**: Quantifies the subjective mental burden experienced by participants using the **NASA-TLX** framework. Triggered immediately after each scenario block.

| Dimension | Field Name | Scale Definition |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Mental Demand** | `nasa_mental` | How mentally demanding was the task? (0-100) |
| **Physical Demand** | `nasa_physical` | How physically demanding was the task? (0-100) |
| **Temporal Demand** | `nasa_temporal` | How hurried or rushed was the pace? (0-100) |
| **Performance** | `nasa_performance` | Perceived success (0=Perfect, 100=Poor). *Note: Reversed scale.* |
| **Effort** | `nasa_effort` | How hard did you have to work? (0-100) |
| **Frustration** | `nasa_frustration` | Level of insecurity, stress, or annoyance. (0-100) |
| **Composite** | `nasa_raw_score` | Unweighted mean of the six dimensions. |
| **Qualitative** | `comments` | Free-text feedback on what made the scenario easy/hard. |

## Data Model Logic

### Deviation Scoring
The system calculates `deviation` to separate "Safe" errors from "Dangerous" errors:
*   **0**: Perfect Match.
*   **Positive (+1, +2)**: **Overtriage**. Assigning higher priority than necessary (e.g., Tagging a "Yellow" patient as "Red"). Wastes resources but safe for patient.
*   **Negative (-1, -2)**: **Undertriage**. Assigning lower priority than required (e.g., Tagging a "Red" patient as "Green"). Potentially dangerous/fatal.

### Gold Standard Fidelity
Gold standards are **tool-specific**. A patient might be "Red" in SMART but "Yellow" in ATS due to specific physiological breakpoints. The system explicitly looks for `Gold_Standard_SMART`, `Gold_Standard_ATS`, etc., ensures fair grading against the rules of the tool being used.
